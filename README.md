# RickAndMortyInvaders

This is a Rick and Morty cartoon themed version of the Space Invaders Game.
I wrote this program in high school, so my programming was not as sophisticated.
There are no interfaces, parent classes, not much OOP as I barely even knew how to use parameters. 

There's an instruction screen included in the game which tells you how to play it.
The game should be played on a desktop/laptop.

Like I said, this is early Haylin programming, three years later, I see many bugs.
I will leave this project here as is and work on an updated version trying to fix what I couldn't before. 
The newer version should be in this repository as well.
Like a mini passion project :)

There is another program from Code.org somewhere here as well, it is a much simpler clicker app which I will also try to improve.


4/12 Update: With the help of one of my counselors, we were able to fix the hidden enemies bug!
Thanks for reading me!
